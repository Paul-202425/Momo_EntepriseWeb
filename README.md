# Momo_EntepriseWeb

 # Project_description

This project is part of a continuous formative assessment where we design and develop an enterprise-level fullstack application. The goal is to process, clean, and analyze MoMo (Mobile Money) SMS transaction data in XML format, store it in a relational database, and build a frontend interface for visualization and insights.

 PROJECT OVERVIEW

The system will:

Ingest & Parse MoMo SMS data in XML format.

Clean & Categorize the data into meaningful transaction types (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, payments, transfers).

Store & Manage the processed data in a relational database for efficient querying.

Visualize & Analyze transactions through an intuitive frontend dashboard.

 OBJECTIVES

Practice collaborative development workflows in a team setting.

Define and document the system architecture (backend, database, and frontend layers).

Apply Agile practices to organize tasks and iterations.

Gain hands-on experience in backend processing, database management, and frontend development.

 WEEK 1 FOCUS

For this first sprint, the primary goals are:

Setting up the teamâ€™s shared workspace (repository, collaboration tools, and workflows).

Defining the system architecture and tech stack.

Creating an Agile board (sprints, epics, and tasks).

 TECH STACK (Proposed)

Backend: Node.js / Python (for XML parsing & data processing)

Database: PostgreSQL / MySQL

Frontend: React.js (with chart libraries for visualization)

Collaboration: GitHub Projects / Jira (Agile task tracking)
